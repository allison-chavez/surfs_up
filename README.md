# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to help W. Avy run an analysis on a dataset to provide concise weather data to determine if, when, and where it would be suitable to open a surfboard and ice cream shop. There were differentiating factors that would impact the stores profitability and sustainability, therefore, we analyzed other competetitors, locations, and most importantly the weather. Running analytics on the weather dataset provided us with proper information to decide on the business venture. For this challenge, W. Avy also wanted me to closely analyze June and December weather data to determine if the shop would be a suitable long year business venture to finalize his business plan.
