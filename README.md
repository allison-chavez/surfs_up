# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to help W. Avy run an analysis on a dataset to provide concise weather data to determine if it would be suitable to open a surfboard and ice cream shop. There were differentiating factors that would impact the stores profitability and sustainability, therefore, we analyzed other competetitors, locations, and most importantly the weather. Running analytics on the weather dataset provided us with proper information to decide on the business venture. For this challenge, W. Avy also wanted me to closely analyze June and December weather data to determine if the shop would be a suitable long year business venture to finalize his business plan.

## Results
Below are the two temperature summaries for the months of June and December:

- The average temperatures for the month of June(75) and December(71) are relatively similar, meaning there is not a drastic average temperature change or drop between these two months. 
- The maximum temperature for June(85) and December(83) are within a small change range as well.
- The minimum temperature for the month of December(56) is 8 degrees lower than June(64). 

## Summary
Completing the additional queries provided us with more in depth information about Hawaii weather and how it would affect the shop. Based on the descirption summary anlysis comepleted we were able to note that there is no drastic temperature changes or effects in the months of June and July. Therefore, the shop is sustainable year long due to the average temperature staying consistent within the same range of ther summer month and winter month. One limitation provided is that the minimum temperature days in December are an 8 degree drop which could potentially affect the shop but it would not be a long term affect. To get more information we can do more monthly analysis to see better temperature trends.
